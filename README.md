# Udacity-Data-Science-Nanodegree-Project
First Project for Udacity Nanodegree Program.

**Project Motivation**:-
1.	Top  Zipcodes with most number of listing?
2.	What kind of property is mostly available?
3.	What are 10 most popular amenities?
4.	Which review score is most important that impacts rating?

**Installations**:-
Default Anaconda package(Jupyter notebook)

**Dataset used**:- 
AirBnB Seattle Listings Dataset

**Libraries used**:-
pandas library
numpy library
matplotlib library
sklearn library
seaborn library

**Files uploaded**
*Udacity_Project-Copy2.ipynb*:- This is a Jupyter Note book containing fully functional codes.

*listings.csv*:- This is the data set used for the project. This is the listing dataset of AirBnB Seattle

**Findings of the Project**
On doing the exploratory data analysis of Seattle AirBnB listing dataset, I can conclude:
1. Zipcodes that has maximum listing.
2. Property Type houses and Apartments capture more than 90% of the Seattle AirBnB listing.
3. Wireless Internet , Smoke Detector , Free Parking are amongst the top amenities that most owners provide.
4. Based on the heatmap plotted, review_score_value has maximum impact on rating
5. Our model can explain almost 2%  variablity.
